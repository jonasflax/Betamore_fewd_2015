Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
  styling HTML
    fonts
    type
    color
    layout
    responsive design
    etc...
  run by the BROWSER, like HTML
  EVERY html element is a BOX
    block level elements are boxes
    inline level elements are boxes
  simulate boxes in chrome dev tools
  CSS allows us to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and its contents) is presented
  CSS associates style rules with html elements
    rules
    selectors
    declarations
      properties
      values
  inline CSS (but don't do)
  external CSS
    create seperate .css document
  multiple external style sheets
  CSS selectors
    id
    class
    tag
    child
    descendant
